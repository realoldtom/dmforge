### Admonitions

The [Admonition plugin](https://github.com/javalent/admonitions) provides additional support for codeblock-style admonitions in addition to callouts.

Import one or more admonition json files in [examples/admonitions][ex-ad] to create the custom admonition types used for converted content:

- [admonitions-5e.json](../examples/admonitions/admonitions-5e.json) for 5e tools
- [admonitions-pf2e.json](../examples/admonitions/admonitions-pf2e-v3.json) for pf2e tools
- [other-admonitions.json](../examples/admonitions/other-admonitions.json) if they are interesting

### Force note view mode by front matter

Use this plugin to treat these generated notes as essentially read-only.

Ensure the plugin has the following options enabled (for the most consistent and least invasive experience):

- *"Ignore force view when not in front matter"*: the plugin will only change the view mode if `obsidianUIMode` is defined in the front matter.
- *"Ignore open files"*: the plugin won't try to change the view mode if the file is already open.

### Fantasy Statblocks

[Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks) maintains a bestiary of monsters. It has its own (handlebars-based) templates for monster statblocks.

To populate *Fantasy Statblocks* from your notes, use the following settings:

- General Settings:
    - *Optional*: Disable the 5e SRD
- Note Parsing:
    - Enable Parse Frontmatter for Creatures
    - *Optional*: Add bestiary folders to constrain where the plugin looks for monsters

You also need to generate content using [templates][5eTools templates] that will populate the bestiary.

### Initiative Tracker

The [Initiative Tracker](https://github.com/javalent/initiative-tracker) plugin for Obsidian allows you to keep track of initiative and turn order during combat encounters in tabletop role-playing games.

- Basic Settings
    - *Optional*: Embed statblock-link content in the creature view.  
        Enable this if you use markdown statblocks and want to see the statblock content in the creature view.
        `statblock-link` must be set in the frontmatter.
- Plugin Integrations
    - *Optional*: Sync monsters from TTRPG Statblocks  
        Enable this if you use the Fantasy Statblocks plugin and want to sync monsters from your notes to the Initiative Tracker.

        - See [Fantasy Statblocks](#fantasy-statblocks) section for recommended settings.
        - Make sure you're using compatible [templates][5eTools templates] for your monsters.

[5eTools templates]: ../examples/templates/tools5e/README.md#5etools-alternate-monster-templates

### Working with Dataview

Notes use lower-kebab-case for filenames. While that works very well for data portability and avoiding
filename collisions, it doesn't look very pretty.

Dataview queries can create entries in tables that use the file's alias instead of the filename, like this:

```md
~~~dataview
TABLE without ID link(file.name, aliases) from "compendium/classes"
FLATTEN aliases
~~~
```
