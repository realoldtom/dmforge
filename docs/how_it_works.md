- Printable PDFs and decks

It emphasizes modular design, testability, and developer support tooling.

| `deck_forge/` | Build card schema, layout, and render output |
| `scene_forge/` | Create randomized or themed adventure scenes |
| `utils/` | Common helpers like environment, config, and file paths |

---

## CLI Commands

See `docs/cli_reference.md`.

---

## Scripts

| Script | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `start_dev.py` | Starts your dev session, reads logs |
| `end_dev.py` | Ends session: runs tests, formats, commits, and logs |
| `release.py` | Tags and pushes a clean release |
| `snapshot.py` | Will generate this file and track file structure |

## Environment Modes

DMForge supports both **dev** and **prod** environments using:
